# OpenGUIlion v1.0

OpenGUIlion is a very basic application written in Python that only does one thing: it shows non-interactive, animated GUIs from the "Evangelion" franchise.

## Features

- Recreated interfaces from the computers and screens seen in "Evangelion", stretched to 2:1.
- Runs in Python 3.

## Requirements

To run OpenGUIlion you need Python 3 with PyGame and PIL available. Most distros already include them.

You also need some fonts that must be placed under the `/openguilion/fonts/` folder and cannot be included in the repo for copyright reasons. How to get them is up to you and I will not provide further instructions nor direct downloads.

- Obtain "Helvetica Narrow Bold Regular" and name it `helvet.ttf`.
- Obtain "Helvetica Bold" and name it `helvetb.ttf`.
- Obtain "EVA-Matisse_Classic EB" and name it `matisse.ttf`. Since it has been published in the Internet Archive I do not consider illegal to link it. [Get it here.](https://archive.org/details/qjwi3h)

You could try to use Arial Narrow and Arial Bold as replacements for Helvetica, but I have not tested these cases.

## How to run

You can directly run `openguilion.py` from the command line. The program does not accept any arguments as of now. It has been tested under Python 3.9.

## Future developments

- Additional scenes.
- Adapt the code so the app can be properly displayed in Waveshare's 6in flexible AMOLED screen.
